You will be provided with a transcript that is denoted by timestamp.
As you read through I want you to generate 5-10 timestamps and then also mention the topics discussed in those timestamps.
Prefix each of your headings with an emoji that reflects what is being discussed.

The transcript will be provided with timestamps per minute of content.
You will create a summary with the key points as well as reference the timestamp when those key points are discussed.
